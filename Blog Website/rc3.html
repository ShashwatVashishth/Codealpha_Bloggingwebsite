    <h1>To eat healthier, start by making small changes. Make each meal or snack contain nutrient-dense foods, and try to avoid processed foods.</h1>
    <h2>Depending on whom you ask, “healthy eating” may take many forms. It seems that everyone, including healthcare professionals, wellness influencers, coworkers, and family members, has an opinion on the healthiest way to eat.

        Plus, nutrition articles that you read online can be downright confusing with their contradictory — and often unfounded — suggestions and rules.
        
        This doesn’t make it easy if you simply want to eat in a healthy way that works for you.
        
        The truth is, healthy eating doesn’t have to be complicated. It’s entirely possible to nourish your body while enjoying the foods you love.
        
        After all, food is meant to be enjoyed — not feared, counted, weighed, and tracked.</h2>
