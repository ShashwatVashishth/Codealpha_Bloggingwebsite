    <h1>How to stay hydrated</h1>
    <h2>Up to 60% of our bodies are made of water. We lose water constantly through our skin, urine, waste and sweat â€“ even when we breathe. Water intake has many benefits, including:
    <ul>
        <li>Regulating internal body temperature</li>
        <li>Metabolizing food and regulating hunger
        </li>
        <li>Lubricating joints</li>
        <li>Flushing bodily waste</li>
        <li>Producing adequate saliva</li>
